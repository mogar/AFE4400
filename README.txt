I build a little breakout board for this that includes LEDs and photodiodes.
Get in touch with me if you want the files to that. I may end up selling them at some point as well.

Note that this code doesn't work yet. 

Future plan:
1. Implementing the code to read the different LED values. (bare minimum for testing)
2. Calculate pulse and oxygen concentration from LED values. (bare minimum for use)
3. Implement ambient light correction.
